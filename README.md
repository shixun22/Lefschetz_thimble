# Lefschetz_thimble
This is a code for finding the Lefschetz thimbles. The Lefschetz thimbles are optimal integration contours for evaluating oscillatory integrals based on the Picard-Lefschetz theory, which has been applied to fields including radio astronomy, condensed matter physics, and quantum cosmology. 

* This particular code features the constant phase contour method which can locate the Lefschetz thimbles efficiently for 1D integrals and can be extended for integrating 2D integrals.
